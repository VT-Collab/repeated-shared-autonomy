Code to setup PyBullet simulations for capacity experiments

[TODO]
- Write code to run simulations with the trained models 

### Instructions

- Use `gen_dataset.py` to create trajectories for a specified set of goals
- Use `train_classifier.py` and `train_cae.py` to train the required networks
- USe `play.py` to run the network in a simulated environment
