Code repository for the IROS 2021 paper ([Learning to share autonomy across repeated interaction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9636748)) and THRI 2023 submission ([SARI: Shared Autonomy across Repeated Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09795)).


# Overview

We use real robots for our simulations and user studies. The IROS work used a FrankaEmika Panda robot with custom code for socket connections and the THRI submission used both the Panda robot and a Universal Robots UR10. We used ROS to communicate with the UR10. The rest of the repository is organized as follows:

- `IROS2021` contains archived code that was used for the experiments in the IROS submission.
- `THRI2023` contains code that was developed for the new work developed for the THRI submission.
